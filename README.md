# timeBasedGmailCleanup
A function to automatically delete emails from your Gmail, for use in Google Apps Script.

## Why use this?
If you're like me, you probably have about 900 unread emails sitting in your inbox. Gmails filters are great, but they don't do anything beyond applying labels and forwarding emails. Honestly, once an email gets to be about a week old, unread or not, I probably thought it was useless based on the subject line. Also most emails are useless after about 2 weeks honestly. I wrote this script to find emails that were too old and delete them. You can delete any email that is older than a specified amount of days or narrow the list down with a search and age and delete only the ones that match that search criteria.
